"""Unit tests for the parallel harness execution path.

These do not need the OpenClaw gateway. They monkey-patch _run_single
with a deterministic stub and verify:

  1. Concurrency=1 reproduces the old serial behavior exactly.
  2. Concurrency>1 actually runs work items in parallel (overlap detected).
  3. Browser tasks are serialized via browser_concurrency=1 even when the
     global concurrency is higher.
  4. Per-task results are aggregated in the correct order.
  5. Speedup at concurrency=N matches the theoretical wall time.
