"""ClawBench v0.5 — Recommendations generator.

The Recommendations section is the prescriptive output that distinguishes
ClawBench from descriptive leaderboards (CLAWBENCH_V0_4_SPEC.md §8
"Configuration Diagnostic Report"). Every recommendation must be backed
by data — either by neighbor profiles that already include the suggested
plugin, or by factor-importance attributions with explicit confidence.

This module generates a ranked list of concrete profile changes from the
historical database + factor analysis + the current profile, with
per-recommendation evidence and a conservative estimated score impact.

No speculative recommendations are generated. If the database is too
small or the evidence too weak, the output is an empty list and the
caller is expected to surface that explicitly in the diagnostic.
