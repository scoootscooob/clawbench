"""ClawBench v0.5 — Ecosystem Insights publisher.

After enough submissions accumulate, ClawBench publishes ecosystem-level
insights derived from the historical fingerprint database
(CLAWBENCH_V0_4_SPEC.md v0.5 §"Community Insights"):

  - Plugin impact leaderboard
  - Strongest interactions
  - Overhyped plugins (would require ClawHub install counts — stubbed)
  - Underrated plugins (same)
  - Capability gaps across task families

This module computes those insights and writes them to the `insights/`
directory as JSON so they can be consumed by the web UI or by plugin
authors via API.
