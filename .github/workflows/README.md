# GitHub Actions

## `ci.yml` — run tests on every push / PR

Runs the repository test suite automatically on:

- every `push` to any branch
- every `pull_request`
- manual dispatch from the Actions tab

It uses Python 3.12, installs the package with `pip install -e .`, then
runs `python -m pytest -q`.

## `sync-to-hf-space.yml` — auto-mirror main to the HF Space

Mirrors every push to `main` into the HF Space git remote so
[huggingface.co/spaces/ScoootScooob/clawbench](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ScoootScooob/clawbench)
always tracks GitHub `main`. GitHub becomes the single source of truth;
the HF Space is a pure deploy target.

## One-time setup (required before the workflow can succeed)

The workflow needs **two repository secrets**. Neither is checked into
the repo; you add them via the GitHub UI.

### 1. Get a Hugging Face access token

1. Go to <https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens>
2. Click **"New token"**
3. Name it something like `clawbench-github-actions`
4. Token type: **"Write"** (read-only will NOT work — the workflow
   needs to push commits to the Space git repo)
5. Click **"Generate a token"** and copy it (you'll only see it once)

### 2. Add the secrets to this repo

1. Go to <https://github.com/scoootscooob/clawbench/settings/secrets/actions>
2. Click **"New repository secret"** and add each of these:

   | Name          | Value                                                      |
   |---------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
   | `HF_TOKEN`    | The write-scoped HF token you created in step 1            |
   | `HF_USERNAME` | `ScoootScooob` (the owner half of the Space path)          |

3. Save both.

### 3. Verify

Either push any commit to `main`, or trigger the workflow manually:

1. Go to the **Actions** tab → **"Sync main to HF Space"**
2. Click **"Run workflow"** → `main` branch → **"Run workflow"**
3. Watch it run. Green check = mirror is live.

After the first successful run, every push to `main` automatically
mirrors to the Space with no further action. You can watch the sync
status under the Actions tab for any commit.

## How the workflow behaves

- **Trigger:** push to `main`, or manual dispatch from the Actions tab.
- **Concurrency:** serialized via `group: sync-to-hf-space` so two
  pushes cannot race into a non-fast-forward rejection.
- **Force:** the push uses `git push --force`. This is intentional —
  anything committed directly on the Space side (e.g. via the HF web
  UI file editor) gets overwritten on the next sync. If you want to
  make a change to the Space, make it on GitHub main and let the
  workflow mirror it.
- **Failure modes:**
  - **Missing secrets** → the `Verify required secrets` step fails with
    a clear error message telling you what to add.
  - **Revoked token** → push fails with a 401; check that `HF_TOKEN`
    still has Write scope on <https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens>.
  - **Wrong username** → push fails with a repo-not-found error; make
    sure `HF_USERNAME` matches the Space owner in the URL.

## Optional: change the target Space

If you ever mirror to a different Space (e.g. a staging copy), set a
repository variable (not a secret) named `HF_SPACE_ID` to the new
Space ID, for example `yourname/clawbench-staging`. The workflow
defaults to `ScoootScooob/clawbench` when the variable is unset.

## Why `--force`?

The contract is: **GitHub is the source of truth for the HF Space's
git history.** The workflow's single job is to make the Space match
GitHub, no matter what. If you want to edit the Space directly (via
the HF file editor), don't — make the change on GitHub and let it
mirror. This avoids the dual-maintainer problem where the two remotes
drift apart over time, which is exactly the situation this workflow
was written to fix.
