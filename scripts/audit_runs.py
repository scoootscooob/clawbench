"""Comprehensive per-run audit across all models in drift_2026-04-19-full.

For each model, cross-references:
  1. Log file (docker_<label>_<tag>.log) — all [N/120] run attempts + their scores
  2. Archived per-run JSONs (run_cache_archive/<tag>/<cache_sub>/<task>/runN.json)
  3. Judge status per cached run (rejudged via direct API or not)

Outputs a fair-comparison table: coverage %, infra-failure %, clean mean,
coverage-normalized score, judge coverage.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/audit_runs.py
